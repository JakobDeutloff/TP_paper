# FaIRv2.0.0 with option to couple CTEM
This repo contains model code of version 2.0.0 of the FaIR simple climate model (https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-390/)
which has been adapted by Jakob Deutloff to allow for the coupling of CTEM to FaIR as described in Deutloff et al. (2023).
The original repository of FaIR can be found under https://github.com/njleach/FAIR/tree/1945d44c7bcf237307264f8a687f65a70ed0e34f.
