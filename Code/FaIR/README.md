# FaIRv2.0.0 with option to couple CTEM
This folder contains model code of version 2.0.0 of the FaIR simple climate model developed by 
[Leach et al. (2021)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/3007/2021/) which has been adapted by Jakob Deutloff
to allow for the coupling of CTEM to FaIR as described in Deutloff et al. (2023).
The original repository of FaIR can be found under https://github.com/njleach/FAIR/tree/1945d44c7bcf237307264f8a687f65a70ed0e34f.
